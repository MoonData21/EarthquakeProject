Real-Time Earthquake Dashboard:

This project is a real-time, interactive earthquake dashboard built with Python, Streamlit, and Pydeck, using data from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. The dashboard visualizes recent earthquakes worldwide on a 3D map, with the ability to filter by magnitude and timeframe.

Features-----

OSM Basemap – 

3D Column Map – column heights proportional to earthquake magnitude

Magnitude Slider – filter earthquakes dynamically by size

Table View – shows most recent earthquakes with date (UTC), place, magnitude, and depth (km)

Tooltips – hover on columns to see earthquake details

Footer – lists data source and libraries used
